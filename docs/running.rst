How to Run
==========

Running the Server
-----------------
The DataSpaces server expects to find the `dataspaces.conf` file in its working directory. 
The format of this file is a list of configuration values, one per line. 
The possible values are as follows:

`<variable> = <value>`, e.g.
`num_apps = 1`

`num_apps`: this value is the number of `dspaces_kill()` calls from clients that are needed to kill the server binary.

`ndim`: number of dimensions for the default global data domain.

`dims`: size of each dimension for the default global data domain.

`max_versions`: maximum number of versions of a data object to be cached in DataSpaces servers.

`hash_version`: the type of distributed hash table used. A value of `1` means that a Hilbert SFC is partitioned into continuous segments and distributed across the servers.
 A value of `2` means the space is partitioned by repeating bisection along the longest domain.

*NOTES* on what values to use

The global dimensions have implications for performance. Data indexing will be partitioned evently across the global dimensions, 
and so if data is only being writtent to a subset of the global dimensions there is a risk of unabalanced indexing load.
Ideally, the data domain being written to will match the global dimensions as closely as possible. The default value set in
`dataspaces.conf` is for convenience. The application can set this per variable with `dspaces_define_gdim()`.

`hash_version = 1` has better locality in the most general case, and should be preferred unless the dimensions of the data 
domain are not a power of two or the ratio of longest to shortest dimension is greater than two.

`num_apps` should be set in conjunction with how `dspaces_kill()` is used in the application(s) using dataspaces. Generally, one rank
of each application should call `dspaces_kill()`, and the number of process groups using dataspaces will be the same as `num_apps`. 
Occasionally, it is not practical to have a client call `dspaces_kill()`, and the dataspaces repo provides a standalone binary `terminator` 
to send a single `dspaces_kill()` and then exit.

Bootstrapping communication
---------------------------
The server produces a bootstrap file during its init phase, `conf.ds`. This file must be read by the clients (or rank zero of the clients 
if `dspaces_init_mpi()` is being used. This file provides the clients with enough information to make initial contact with the server and
perform wire-up. In order to find this file, the server and client application must be run in the same working directory, or at last a symlink of `ds.conf` should be present.

Environment variables
---------------------
There are a few environment variables that can be used to influence DataSpaces.

`DSPACES_DEBUG` - enables substantial debug output for both clients and server.

`DSPACES_DEFAULT_NUM_HANDLERS` - the number of request handling threads launched by the server (in addition to the main thread). Default: 4.
 This value should be changed if it is likely to oversubscribe or underutilize the node the server is running on.

 Running the server
 ------------------

The server binary, `dspaces_server`, takes a single argument: the listen_address. This is a Mercury-specific connection string (see Mercury documentation for details.) Common values are: `sockets` to use TCP for communication, `sm` for shared memory (if all clienta and server processes are on the same node) and `ofi+X` for RDMA, where `X` is `verbs`, `psm2`, or `cray` as is appropriate for the system fabric.
